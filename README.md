This API is a simple user authentication system built using Node.js, Express, bcrypt, and JWT (JSON Web Token). It includes three main endpoints: /api/register, /api/login, and /api/protected. The /api/register endpoint allows users to register by submitting a username and password, where the password is securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in an array. Upon successful registration, a confirmation message is returned. The /api/login endpoint verifies the user's credentials by comparing the entered password with the stored hashed password using bcrypt.compare(). If valid, a JWT token is generated using jwt.sign() with an expiration time of one hour. This token is required to access the /api/protected endpoint, which is secured by the authenticateToken middleware. This middleware extracts the token from the Authorization header, verifies it, and grants access if valid. Environment variables such as PORT and SECRET_KEY are used to enhance security and flexibility. Overall, this API provides a basic yet effective implementation of user registration, login, and protected route access, suitable for applications requiring simple authentication features.
